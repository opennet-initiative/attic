Strip all the IP options from a packet.

(Please note: This target requires kernel support that
might not be available in official Linux kernel sources or
Debian's packaged Linux kernel sources.
And if support for this target is available for the 
specific Linux kernel source version, that support might 
not be enabled in the current Linux kernel binary.)

The target doesn't take any option, and therefore is extremely easy to use :

# iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j IPV4OPTSSTRIP
