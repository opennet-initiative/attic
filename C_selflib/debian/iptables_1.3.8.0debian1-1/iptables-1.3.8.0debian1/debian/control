Description: administration tools for packet filtering and NAT
 netfilter and iptables provide a Linux kernel framework for
 stateful and stateless packet filtering, network and port address
 translation, and other IP packet manipulation. The framework is
 the successor to ipchains.
 .
 netfilter and iptables are used in applications such as Internet
 connection sharing, firewalls, IP accounting, transparent proxying,
 advanced routing and traffic control.
 .
 Please note: the iptables extensions included in this package
 require kernel support that might not be available in official Linux
 kernel sources or Debian's packaged Linux kernel sources. And if 
 support for any extension is available for the specific Linux kernel
 source version, that support might not be enabled in the Linux kernel
 binary in use.
 .
 In particular, kernel patches for IPV4OPTSSTRIP, TARPIT, ipv4options,
 u32 and set are currently located in patch-o-matic-ng via the netfilter
 website. patch-o-matic-ng patches are often imported into the official
 Linux kernel source tree.
