There used to be a horribly outdated version of the teucrium traffic grapher
here. At the time of writing, current versions of teucrium are available
from:
 * http://git.memespace.net/git/teucrium.git/
 * git://github.com/sh01/teucrium.git
If you get one of those, you'll also want gonium, which newer teucrium versions
depend on:
 * http://git.memespace.net/git/gonium.git/
 * git://github.com/sh01/gonium.git


If you *really* want the ancient versions hosted here, the previous SVN
revisions of this directory will provide them. However, I strongly discourage
using them: They're less featureful, less documented and a lot more pain
to deploy than newer versions of teucrium.
