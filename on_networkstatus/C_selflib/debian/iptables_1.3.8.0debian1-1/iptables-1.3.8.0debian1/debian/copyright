linux kernel sources were downloaded from:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/

linux kernel author:
  
  Linus Torvalds and many, many others. See the CREDITS file in
  the top dir of the linux kernel source for a partial list of
  contributors.

linux kernel license:

     NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that
   use kernel services by normal system calls - this is merely
   considered normal use of the kernel, and does *not* fall under
   the heading of "derived work". Also note that the GPL below is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, but the instance of
   code that it refers to (the Linux kernel) is copyrighted by me
   and others who actually wrote it.

   Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as
   the kernel is concerned is _this_ particular version of the
   license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly
   otherwise stated.
